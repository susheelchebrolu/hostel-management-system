# hostel-management-system
cross platform app using flutter which helps to post individual problems who lives in hostel.

The target of the Hostel Management System is to get digitized , decrease upkeep of records to talk about different personal problems faced in hostel as well as common problems that are faced by hostellers can be discussed. 
We have realized that normally in the hostel the board keep up a book to record issues or problems of the students who are living in hostel, yet they need to hold up until it is seen by somebody and settled by the specific approved individual and it get couple of days to get the issue solved .So the utilization of Hostel ticketing application will maintain a strategic distance from the such situation and be all the more faster in taking care of the issues. It is progressively adaptable in light of the fact that the application has every one of the general population included, for example, Admin , superintendents ,individuals managing power or electrical machines , plumbing issues etc, so the students can legitimately post their issue and the issue will be advised straightforwardly to the relating individuals who are managing it .By this when the problems are getting legitimately informed it makes their work increasingly simpler and the issue can be a lot sooner than the typical time
